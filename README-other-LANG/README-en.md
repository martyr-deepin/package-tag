## 

### What does this project do?
This project is mainly used to record the tag version number and download link of the stable version of each project of `Deepin`



### Why create this project
Since `linuxdeepin` updated the tags of each project too frequently, and the latest tag and the previous tag have not changed much and there may be unknown bugs. This project records the tested stable tag version  and download links of each project



### Who will use this project
There are many enthusiasts and maintainers of `DDE` who want to push `DDE` and some `Deepin` applications to other `Linux` distributions. Normally, maintainers will use the latest tag of the project by default, but as above It is said that the tags of each project are updated too frequently, the latest tag and the previous tag have not changed much and there may be unknown bugs, so this project was created to facilitate other maintainers to get stable and tested tag versions



### I still want to use the latest version 

The tag version number and download link sorted out here are only recommended, because this version has been tested and tested in the community  for a period of time without serious bugs. However, if you still want to use the latest version and experience the latest features, you can still go to the relevant projects to pull the latest code to build. It's up to you. Here,  just  a recommendation
